> **歌詞登録ステータス：同期歌詞あり**

```lrc
[00:01.64] I set upon the sea
[00:03.60] To search for phantom sails from tales my mum told me
[00:07.30] A ghostly galleon filled with gold, she sails alone
[00:11.41] No crew, nor captain's guiding hand
[00:13.62] Can tame the one the sailors call The Shadow
[00:35.62] 
[00:16.93] Sun and horizon met
[00:19.39] I weighed the anchor, hoisted sails, my course was set
[00:23.18] My cutthroat crew conspiring with the stars our guide
[00:27.37] They point the way through perils fraught
[00:29.35] And lead us to the one they call The Shadow
[00:50.85] 
[00:33.10] None can tame the one the sailors call The Shadow
[00:57.60] 
[00:37.03] Lean left! (Lean left!)
[00:39.14] Hard right! (Hard right!)
[00:41.06] Hold tightly to her helm
[00:42.69] She'll try to drown you just for spite
[00:44.98] Heave, ho! (Heave, ho!)
[00:46.80] 'Til first light! (First light!)
[00:48.49] She'll give a fight to all who try to claim The Shadow
[00:52.16] None can tame the one the sailors call The Shadow
[01:16.66] 
[00:56.14] A mighty tempest grew
[00:58.69] The banshee cried, "Turn back", but our resolve was true
[01:02.39] We pointed bow ahead and shouted, we'll break through!
[01:06.33] The jaws of hell can't hold us back
[01:08.40] There's nothing that can keep us from The Shadow
[01:32.40] 
[01:11.96] The winds blew stronger still
[01:14.49] The ocean raged against us, tried to break our will
[01:17.97] The sirens in the water, thirsty for the kill
[01:21.79] Our vessel reelin' to and fro
[01:23.94] To bear us to the one they call The Shadow
[01:44.94] 
[01:27.50] None can keep us from the one they call The Shadow
[01:52.50] 
[01:31.91] Lean left! (Lean left!)
[01:34.09] Hard right! (Hard right!)
[01:35.81] Hold tightly to her helm
[01:37.72] She'll try to drown you just for spite
[01:39.70] Heave, ho! (Heave, ho!)
[01:41.63] 'Til first light! (First light!)
[01:43.45] She'll give a fight to all who try to claim The Shadow
[01:47.00] None can tame the one the sailors call The Shadow
[02:11.50] 
[01:51.22] As thunder split the sky
[01:53.42] The lightning drew a shape beyond the tempest's eye
[01:57.35] A chill ran through me spine as legend came alive
[02:01.32] "Avast!", I cried all hands as we
[02:03.06] Prepare to take the one they call The Shadow
[02:06.80] "All hands!"
[02:12.80] 
[02:26.89] As we approached her shell
[02:30.15] The skies went silent, seas went calm as if by spell
[02:35.28] No signs of fight or flight were in her, all was well
[02:40.90] Until I tried to take her helm
[02:55.90] 
[02:45.75] Her rigging came alive
[02:47.54] She hung my crew before me eyes
[02:49.64] She stole my sight and cursed me, Captain of The Shadow
[02:52.94] She took my eyes and cursed me, Captain of The Shadow
[03:19.44] 
[02:57.74] Lean left! (Lean left!)
[02:59.48] Hard right! (Hard right!)
[03:01.34] Steer clear of her, I fear she'll eat your soul, she'll take your life
[03:05.21] Heave, ho! (Heave, ho!)
[03:07.07] 'Til first light! (First light!)
[03:09.02] She'll claim the souls of those who try to tame The Shadow
[03:12.42] None can tame the one the sailors call The Shadow
[03:16.34] None can tame the one the sailors call The Shadow
